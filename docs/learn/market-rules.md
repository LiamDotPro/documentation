# Market Creation and Permitted Markets

There are **two kinds of markets**. And **two kinds of market refusals**

- **Advised markets** require a **200 ZTG bond** and have to be **approved by
  the**
  [Advisory Committee](https://www.notion.so/Advisory-Committee-7d7c085c56964e63978de4c875a5f52f)
  and can be rejected (with the loss of the bond)
  - Here we reject markets which are **poorly defined**
  - We lay out our rules below, but our rule of thumb is “**if it has any chance
    of confusing people or resolving ambiguously, we will not approve it**”
- [Permissionless](https://www.notion.so/Permissionless-markets-7ac029cbf7114bc48340658a97dbceac)
  markets are created **without approval** and cost a **1000 ZTG bond**
  - Here we will **retroactively remove** markets which we **expect to cause
    significantly more harm than benefit** or which **flippantly discuss awful
    outcomes**
  - We will **never remove markets lightly**
  - We **will not remove poorly defined permissionless markets**, but **you will
    probably lose money on them**, so it’s a bad idea.

In future we would like to move towards most markets being permissionless, since
this allows users more freedom and requires less time from the
[Advisory Committee](https://www.notion.so/Advisory-Committee-7d7c085c56964e63978de4c875a5f52f).
We will need to build a process to support users here.

**Proposal: Anyone who reports a market to us that we don’t permit gets half the
bond.**

## Approved markets

_What they are, pre-approval and markets which will not be approved_

@Nathan is currently building an optional **off-chain pre-approval process** for
users to work together to create high quality markets you can see it here:
[Community Market Approvals](https://www.notion.so/Community-Market-Approvals-1a32717fff34448bba0edfb4da10eeae).
Once markets complete this process users are encouraged to submit them to the
Approvals Comittee

Steps in the off-chain pre-approval process:

- Type a suggested title
- Author,
  [Advisory Committee](https://www.notion.so/Advisory-Committee-7d7c085c56964e63978de4c875a5f52f)
  and other users improve title add resolution criteria
- Users upvote using notion
- More effort is focused on questions more users have voted on
- Once two people put their names by a market it, the author is advised to send
  it to the
  [Advisory Committee](https://www.notion.so/Advisory-Committee-7d7c085c56964e63978de4c875a5f52f)

Markets can also be submitted directly to the
[Advisory Committee](https://www.notion.so/Advisory-Committee-7d7c085c56964e63978de4c875a5f52f)
but these are much more likely to be rejected with users losing their bonds.

The **average (median) user expects to be betting in a fair environment**. They
expect things to “**just work**” and for **markets to mean what it seems like
they mean**. While there is room for a “wild west” of experimental markets, the
[Advisory Committee](https://www.notion.so/Advisory-Committee-7d7c085c56964e63978de4c875a5f52f)
gives its approval to markets that users can trust without question.

**Zeitgeist pays a high price to remove its markets**. Hence a bad market cannot
be quickly altered. If a market resolves too soon.. it resolves too soon. There
are no easy take-backs on the blockchain.

We therefore reject markets that are badly written or confusing. Users will lose
their bounties.

**Markets the
[Advisory Committee](https://www.notion.so/Advisory-Committee-7d7c085c56964e63978de4c875a5f52f)
will reject**

- **Markets without clear questions**
  - e.g. “What’s going to happen in Ukraine?”
    - While users might have some sense of what this market is about, it is not
      clear from the question. Users must be able to get an accurate view of
      what the market is about from just reading the question
    - To put this another way, if more than 1% of users read the question and
      imagine the market is about something it’s not about and bet on it, this
      is too many.
- **Markets without clear resolution criteria**
  - e.g. “Who will win the 2024 US Presidential election” Resolution criteria:
    “This resolves as the winner of the election”
    - This was not good resolution criteria in 2020. Do we want the person who
      won according to AP? The person who got the most votes? The person who
      gets the most electors, even if some are “faithless electors” (this sounds
      charged, but is a technical term)?
    - We need a clear resolution source. If we want to ask a question about what
      Zeitgeist or a certain user judges, then that should be _explicit_ within
      the criteria
- **Markets with outcomes which do not consider all major possible outcomes**
  - e.g “Who will win UFC #290?” Outcomes: Adam Abbes, Balijis Bhat
    - UFC fights are regularly postponed or cancelled. There needs to be a
      “fight cancelled” option. Without this, the market could resolve
      uncertainly. This will be a huge mess.
    -
- **Markets which close to long before, or too long after an event has
  happened**
  - e.g. “Who will win the 2022 world cup, if that event takes place” Resolution
    date: July 2022
    - We have a 4 day reporting limit. Markets have to report within this time.
      So here there would be no way to resolve the market because it finished
      far too early.
  - e.g. “Who will win the 2022 world cup, if that event takes place” Resolution
    date: 2024
    - There is no reason for the market to stay open this long. Users might be
      and be confused
- **No ambiguous option**
  - eg “Will Nadal win Wimbledon?” Options:
  - We aim to keep poorly resolved approved markets at or below 1%
- **Confusing images**
- **Wrong categories**

## Permissionless markets

_What they are, markets we always remove and harms_

Zeitgeist removes markets which on expectation cause much more harm than the
information/incentives they create.

The following list would seem to go without saying. But we will say them to make
our expectations clear. **By making clear bright lines, we free the community to
make infinite and interesting markets within the large space of permitted
markets**. If you create markets like this we will be upset with you. Likewise,
if we remove markets unnecessarily, you should rightly be upset with us.

Markets we always reject:

- We always reject or retroactively remove markets predict specific awful crimes
  - Forbidden markets
    - **Explicit market titles/descriptions/images**
      - Rather than “Will that [expletive] arsehole Dave get fired” you can
        write “Will Dave get fired”
    - **Individuals being harmed**
      - Rather than “Will [world leader] be harmed” you can write ‘When will
        world leader leave office”
    - **Locations or individual months suffering acts of terrorism**
      - Rather than “Will [city/month] have [act of terrorism]” you can write
        predict on the level of states, countries or years
    - **Markets which cause Zeitgeist to break national laws**
      - eg markets which create ways for US citizens to bet
    - **We reserve the right to add to this list things which cause the same
      magnitude of harm when predicted**
    - We also reserve the right to **remove markets around the privacy of
      private individuals**. We will write more guidance as this issue becomes
      clearer to us
    - Finally, **we reserve the right to remove markets which seek to game our
      rules**. We will have a high bar for this, but should there be low
      liquidity markets which seek to go right to the edge of what is permitted,
      we may take action against those markets
- Why do we care?
  - Zeitgeist is a place where anyone can create markets. **But with personal
    freedom comes the personal freedom of others. Some markets could create
    harm. Where that harm is likely to be much larger than the benefit, we will
    consider, then remove those markets.**
  - While markets predict, they also incentivise. Placing a large bet on
    something not happening is equivalent to offering a large reward for it
    happening and allowing others to signal that they are working on it.
    Sometimes this is a fun or beneficial side effect. Sometimes it is a harm to
    be mitigated.
  - For any genuinely interesting question, it is possible to frame markets in a
    way that doesn’t have these bad outcomes. If there isn’t, then it’s not a
    market that is good to make
  - Zeitgeist is allows far more freedom of action here than other prediction
    markets. If you wish to discuss this, please have an example of a specific
    market you wish to create. Responding to queries here is a lower priority
    than creating interesting markets and building new technology.
